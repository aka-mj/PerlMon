			README file for the PerlMon package
			
			
Dependencies required by PerlMon:
	
	Perl
	Gtk2 (optional) (needed to run PerlMon in GUI mode)
	Gtk2-Perl (only needed if you do not have a full Gtk2 collection)
	Glib (no longer needed as of release 0.1.1)
	Nvidia driver (Optional) (provides better GPU information)
		(ATI and Intel support will come in later releases)
	
			
How to unpack a PerlMon package:

	Open a terminal(console) and move to the directory where you 
		saved the PerlMon package, and type the following.
	
	** IF IN A .TAR.GZ ARCHIVE **
	tar zxvf PerlMon-{VERSION}
	cd PerlMon-{VERSION}
	
	** IF IN A .ZIP ARCHIVE **
	unzip PerlMon-{VERSION}
	cd PerlMon-{VERSION}
	
NOTE: Currently you don't need to install anything to run PerlMon, 
	as long as Perl is installed you can run in text mode and 
	if Gtk2 is installed you can run in GUI mode.
	I plan on providing a basic installer some time soon.
	
	
How to run PerlMon:
	
	Running PerlMon is as easy as simple double clicking on the script
	file called "perlmon".
	
	If that does not work for you, then open up a terminal and move to
	the PerlMon folder and type "perl perlmon"
	
	Example:
		perl perlmon
		
		
PerlMon can run a Gtk2 based GUI or a text dump in a terminal.
By default the PerlMon script will display a GUI. To run PerlMon without 
a GUI, then you will have to run PerlMon in a terminal with the --nogui
option.

	Example:
		perl perlmon --nogui
		-OR-
		perl perlmon -n
		
		
To find what version of PerlMon you are running you can use the --version
option in the terminal.
	
	Exapmle:
		perl perlmon --version
		-OR-
		perl perlmon -v

To view all of the options you can run with PerlMon, you can use the 
--help option.
	
	Example:
		perl perlmon --help
		-OR-
		perl perlmon -h
